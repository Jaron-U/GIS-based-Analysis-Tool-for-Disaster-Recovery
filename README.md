# GIS-based-Analysis-Tool-for-Disaster-Recovery

The project, GIS-based Analysis Tool for Disaster Recovery, references a tool-set of software interfaces which have been developed by us to help Emergency Managers in planning recovery efforts and forming evacuation plans in the event of and in preparation for a natural disaster.  The tool-set includes multiple ArcGIS Pro Toolboxes for GIS experts to extend their tool-chains in their analysis of natural disasters, as well as a stand-alone web-map for all to use in calculating routes that avoid geographic hazards.

## Repository Layout
- Toolboxes are located in `gis/toolboxes`
- Web-map code is located in the root directory.
